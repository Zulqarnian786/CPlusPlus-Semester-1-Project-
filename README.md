# CPlusPlus-Semester-1-Project-
University Admission Management System is a console-based C++ application developed as a 1st semester Programming Fundamentals project. The system simulates a basic university admission process by allowing users to set login credentials, apply for admission, and view results. It collects student academic information, calculates HSSC percentage and aggregate marks, and determines eligibility for different programs based on predefined criteria. The project demonstrates the use of core C++ concepts such as functions, arrays, conditional statements, loops, input validation, and modular programming to solve a real-world problem in an organized and efficient manner.
